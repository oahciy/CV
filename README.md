I am a Junior Front-End Developer, looking for a role to launch my career in Software Engineering. I love the fact how versatile and helpful a developer can be in almost every different sector. Initially trained as a battery scientist, I explored using Python and R to automate test data collection and analysis, and then gradually shifted my interest towards software engineering.
